# GDMC
### Who am I?
I'm AHumanIBelieve: a programmer, composer, TTRPG-maker, comic-er and gamer.
More info can be found at my website: [ahumanibelieve.github.io](https://ahumanibelieve.github.io "ahumanibelieve.github.io")
### What's this?
This is my repo documenting my progress as I learn to procedurally generate structures in [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) for the [GDMC](https://gendesignmc.engineering.nyu.edu/) competition. I originally intended for this to be finished for the 2023 competition, but will probably enter for the 2024 one instead. 

### What have I done, and what do I intend to do?
- [x] Learn basic GDPC
- [ ] Attempt to create a fort, with full interior and walls.
- [ ] Create a town surrounding the fort.
- [ ] House variation.
- [ ] More walls.
- [ ] Automatic bridges.
- [ ] A storyline, somehow.
